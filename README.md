Overview
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify cancer patients based on DNA sequences. By analyzing gene data, it aims to predict the presence of cancer and determine the level of care required for patients. The project provides a comprehensive approach to early cancer detection, offering a powerful tool for healthcare professionals to diagnose and treat cancer more effectively.

Dataset
The dataset comprises DNA sequences from cancer patients with five output classes representing different types of tumors:

BRCA (Breast Cancer)
KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma)
COAD (Colon Adenocarcinoma)
LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma)
PRAD (Prostate Adenocarcinoma)
